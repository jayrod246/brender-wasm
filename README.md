# BRender in the Browser
An example of BRender rendering a spinning teapot in the web browser using wasi and Zig. To see it in action, visit: https://jayrod246.github.io/brender-wasm

This repo is based on a fork of [minimal-zig-wasm-canvas](https://github.com/daneelsan/minimal-zig-wasm-canvas).

The teapot example is based heavily on this [SDL sample](https://github.com/bjrkk/brenSDL).

Bit of warning: this code has not been cleaned up! it's old code, from way earlier this year, that I repurposed to test out the [brender Zig library](https://github.com/jayrod246/brender).
